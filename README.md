Welcome to the world of Pixel Fight. 
Here the mission to accomplish: - save the king's daughter who has been kidnapped by an evil prince. To do so, you will have to defeat the evil prince. 
Beware, the dangers will be multiple. 

	Throughout your quest, you will be under the threat of attacks from various monsters.
 But fortunately, you will also be able to find potions allowing you to improve your abilities. You can find : - life-altering potion - Attack Booth Potion. You'll have an inventory where you can find collected and unused potions.
	You have a starting level that will increase thanks to the XP gained in your battles. You also have HP. Finally, you'll have defense and attack abilities. The higher your level is, the more those increase. It is the same for monsters. The higher their level, the higher their attack and defense abilities. 
	In case of a monster attack, you will have three possibilities: -Attack - Escape - Take a potion to increase your abilities. (once used, the potion disappears from your inventory). Then at each turn of the fight: you can do only one action (attack or drink a potion). Each monster has a level, HP, attack and defense skills.
 
 Your strike causes damage depending on your strike level and the monster's defense level. The reverse is also true when the monster attacks you.
	 To win the fight, you must kill the monster by reducing their HP level to 0. But beware, if it is your HP level which is at 0, it is you who will die. Be alert! It's possible that one shot is missing out or that another one is fatal.
In case of death, the game is over, you have lost. 
	To win the game, you must have killed the evil prince. Beware, he has the highest level of the game. It is therefore better to have defeated several monsters in order to have a high level before fighting him.
